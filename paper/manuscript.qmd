# Introduction

This is the introduction to my paper. Here is my first citation [@Angrist1991].

## Methods

We use a very clever method to analyze our data.

# Results

Our results are groundbreaking. As seen in Figure 1, the effect is clear.

```{python}
#| label: fig-myplot
#| fig-cap: "This is the caption for my amazing plot."

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# This is a placeholder plot.
# In reality, you would load your processed data here.
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Sine Wave")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.show()

#| label: tbl-mytable
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics of the mtcars dataset."
#| results: asis # This outputs the raw LaTeX code for the table

# This is a placeholder using R's built-in data.
# In reality, you would load your model results.
# The 'modelsummary' package is excellent for this.
